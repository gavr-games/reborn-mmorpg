# Game Mechanics

## Claims

Players can build bases/farms. Honestly speaking they can build it anywhere. 

You need a base to protect your items. The items are protected from other players (cannot take/destroy/chop) only if you build something inside the Claim Area.

Claim Area - is an area aroun Claim Obelisk. you can craft it from craft menu.

Claim Obelisk can expire after 4 weeks. To extend the rent you should pay for it.

Each character can have only one obelisk installed.

Two Claim Areas cannot intersect.

## Containers

Containers have different size. You can put smaller containers inside bigger ones.
